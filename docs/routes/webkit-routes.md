## **Webkit**
Below are routes which are directly related to the browser functions of Skate 3

### 404 (/skate3/webkit/PS3/ErrorPages/404)

The 404 page, automatically redirects whenever the service can't be viewed, denied due to no authorization or doesn't exist.
Doesn't have auth which seemed to be the attack vector which allowed me to get to the 'admin' page shown above 
unless it was supposed to be that way.
