# Netplay docs

This repo serves as a place where every single note about the game's netplay will be stored, 
this serves as a repo to continue any possibly to restoring the servers for Skate 3 or to just learn about how it works in general.

Find the documents needed to start learning below.
[Routes](./docs/routes.md)
More to come! but for now check out [Hall of meat's research notes](https://github.com/hallofmeat/notes), it helpfully details PS3 tickets, the servers used within Skate 3 and some on the routes for skate.community and EA webkit itself.
